# Morse_Code_Decoder

This Morse Code Decoder is able to convert English to Morse Code, as well as Morse Code to English.

As an extention, I have also looked at users being able to enter Morse Code using mouse clicks, with the length of press representing dots and dashes. This feature is still a work in progress.

This project was made with HTML5, Javascript and CSS
